# Fabric & Power BI Toolkit — Agent Instructions

This workspace has 3 MCP servers configured:
1. **fabric-core** — 138+ tools for Microsoft Fabric management (workspaces, lakehouses, SQL, DAX, notebooks, pipelines, OneLake, Graph, Git, CI/CD, environments, connections, admin, item definitions, Spark jobs, raw API)
2. **powerbi-modeling** — Microsoft's Power BI Modeling MCP for live semantic model editing in Power BI Desktop
3. **powerbi-translation-audit** — Translation validation tools (scan for untranslated content, PASS/FAIL verdict)

To re-run setup: Command Palette > **Fabric & Power BI: Full Setup**

## fabric-core: Context Flow

- Always `set_workspace` before other operations
- Always `set_lakehouse` or `set_warehouse` before SQL/table operations
- Use `list_tables` or `SELECT TOP 1 *` to discover schema before writing queries

## fabric-core: SQL Rules

- Always pass `type` ("lakehouse" or "warehouse") to sql_query, sql_explain, sql_export
- Fabric SQL endpoints are read-only — no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL
- New delta tables take 5-10 min to appear in SQL endpoint
- Use T-SQL dialect with FORMAT() for readable numbers
- NEVER guess table names, schemas, or column names. When querying a lakehouse for the first time:
  1. Run `SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` to discover what exists
  2. Run `SELECT TOP 1 * FROM <schema>.<table>` on relevant tables to get actual column names
  3. Then write the real query using the discovered names
  Column conventions vary wildly (PascalCase, snake_case, etc). Always discover, never assume.

## fabric-core: Data Questions

- Translate natural language to SQL automatically — don't ask, just query
- When querying unfamiliar data, silently discover tables and columns first, then write the query. Don't show the discovery steps to the user unless they ask.
- Format results as markdown tables
- Default to TOP 20 for ranked queries
- Suggest follow-up analyses when relevant

## fabric-core: Semantic Models & DAX

- Add descriptions when creating measures
- Use format strings (e.g., "#,0.00", "0.0%") on measures
- When gold tables are created, suggest relevant DAX measures

## fabric-core: OneLake

- `onelake_ls` browses Files path by default — use `path: "Tables"` for delta tables
- Shortcuts reference data without copying — prefer over duplication

## fabric-core: Notebooks

- Use `create_pyspark_notebook` with templates (basic, etl, analytics, ml)
- `run_notebook_job` + `get_run_status` to execute and poll
- `update_notebook_cell` caches the original notebook before writing — use `restore_notebook` to undo if needed
- If a notebook read fails during update, the operation aborts to prevent data loss

## fabric-core: Naming Conventions

- Bronze: `{source}_{entity}_raw`
- Silver: `{entity}_clean`
- Gold: `fact_{entity}`, `dim_{entity}`
- Measures: `Total {Metric}`, `{Metric} YTD`, `{Metric} Growth %`

## powerbi-modeling: Usage

Use ToolSearch for `powerbi-modeling` to discover available tools.
Common operations: translate semantic model captions, manage cultures, edit model metadata, create/edit measures, batch operations.
This server talks to a **running Power BI Desktop instance** — the report must be open in Desktop.

## Agent Routing

For multi-domain tasks, use `/deploy-agents` to launch parallel subagents with domain-specific expertise.

For single-domain tasks, read the relevant agent file first:
- **ETL, lakehouses, notebooks** → `.claude/agents/data-engineer.md`
- **DAX, semantic models** → `.claude/agents/dax-analyst.md`
- **Translations** → `.claude/agents/translator.md`
- **SQL, analytics** → `.claude/agents/sql-analyst.md`
- **Git, CI/CD, pipelines** → `.claude/agents/cicd-engineer.md`

## Known Limitations

| Tool | Issue |
|------|-------|
| `install_requirements` / `install_wheel` | Non-functional — returns guidance to use Environments API or Fabric portal instead. |
| `create_measure` / `update_measure` / `delete_measure` / `get_model_schema` | Only works with user-created semantic models. Auto-generated lakehouse default models don't support `getDefinition`. |
| `set_permissions` | Workspace-level only. Fabric REST API doesn't support item-level permissions. |
| Lakehouse SQL | Read-only. No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL. New delta tables take 5-10 min to appear. |

## raw_api_call: Universal API Escape Hatch

For **any** Fabric, Power BI, Graph, or OneLake operation not covered by the built-in tools above, use the `raw_api_call` tool.
It supports 4 audiences (`fabric`, `powerbi`, `graph`, `storage`) with automatic Azure token management.

**Before calling:** read `raw-api/INDEX.md` to find the correct endpoint, method, and request body.
Do NOT read more than 3 docs per call: INDEX → audience _index → category file.
